This is a simple example on how to use tasks and protected objects in Ada to
solve the problem of emptying a Pez dispenser. Yea, I know it's not the most 
common of problems, but there you have it.

The sequential program solves it sequentially while the concurrent program
solves it by starting a bunch of concurrent workers.

To compile and execute:

   $ cd sequential
   $ gnatmake -P sequential.gpr
   $ time sequential

Substitute "sequential" with "concurrent" in the above to try the concurrent
program.

Enjoy!
